          			    This application was designed mainly as a schedule for FOSDEM, but also as assistant for your
          			    conference weekend in Brussels. It downloads the schedule from FOSDEM server and saves it to your device. 
          			    So you can use the schedule offline. You can also set your favorite schedule items to plan your 
          			    conference visit. There are also various maps included for your orientation as well as feeds for
          			    having a quick glance what's going on at the FOSDEM website, identi.ca and Twitter hashtags and so on.

      			            <strong>Schedule.</strong><br /> After you fetched the schedule from FOSDEM server for the first time,
      			            it's stored on your device for later offline use. But remember to refresh it later (with the "refresh"
      			            button in the middle) since the schedule changes often at least until a few days before the conference.
      			            <br /><i>Details:</i> Tap on an event to view detailed information. On the bottom of the event details 
      			            you can set an event as favorite. <br /><i>Favorites</i> are marked with a red heart. In the menu on the bottom 
      			            you can toggle between all events and your favorite events. This feature should help you with organizing 
      			            your conference visit. Favorites are preserved even when refreshing the schedule.<br />
      			            Simply start typing to <i>search</i> in all titles, locations and attendees.

      			            <strong>Maps.</strong><br /> Use the maps section for orientation. Use the right map menu to select
      			            a map of your choice. Zoom into the map with double-tap or the zoom gesture. The maps are included
      			            with the kind permission of the copyright holders.

      			            <strong>Feeds.</strong><br /> To have an easy glance at FOSDEM news and the #fosdem noise in
      			            the microblogging sphere, there's a simple reader included. You can read the FOSDEM website news
      			            as well as "dents"/"tweets" from FOSDEM accounts, groups and hashtags at identi.ca and Twitter.
      			            Just select the desired feed over the bottom-right feed menu.<br />
      			            This functionality requires an online-connection, the content doesn't get saved on the device.
      			            Tap an item to open it with the webbrowser. It's there for convenience, but can and should not replace 
      			            a great, full-featured microblogging client like Spaz.
