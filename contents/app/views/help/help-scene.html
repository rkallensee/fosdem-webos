                        This application was designed mainly as a schedule for FOSDEM, but also as assistant for your
                        conference weekend in Brussels. It downloads the schedule from FOSDEM server and saves it to your device.
                        So you can use the schedule offline. You can also set your favorite schedule items to plan your
                        conference visit. There are also various maps included for your orientation as well as feeds for
                        having a quick glance what's going on at the FOSDEM website, identi.ca and Twitter.

                            <strong>Schedule.</strong><br /> After you fetched the schedule from FOSDEM server for the first time,
                            it's stored on your device for later offline use. But remember to refresh it later (with the "refresh"
                            button in the middle) since the schedule changes often at least until a few days before the conference.
                            <br />
                            <i>Details:</i> Tap on an event to view detailed information. On the bottom of the event details
                            you can set an event as favorite. <br />
                            <i>Favorites and upcoming events.</i> Favorites are marked with a red heart. In the menu on the bottom-right
                            you can toggle between all events (first option), your favorite events (second option with the red heart) and
                            all upcoming events (the third option with the clock). The upcoming events option hides all events in the
                            past. Favorites are preserved even the schedule gets refreshed.<br />
                            Simply start typing to <i>search</i> in all titles, descriptions, locations and attendees.

                            <strong>Maps.</strong><br /> Use the maps section for orientation. Use the right map menu to select
                            a map of your choice. Zoom into the map with double-tap or the zoom gesture. Additionally there's a
                            link to the mobile timetable of STIB, Brussels' urban public transport company.

                            <strong>Feeds.</strong><br /> To have an easy glance at FOSDEM news and the #fosdem noise in
                            the microblogging sphere, there's a simple reader included. You can read the FOSDEM website news
                            as well as messages from FOSDEM accounts, groups and hashtags at identi.ca and Twitter.
                            Just select the desired feed over the bottom-right feed menu.<br />
                            This functionality requires an online-connection, the content doesn't get saved on the device.
                            Tap an item to open it with the webbrowser. It's there for convenience, but can and should not replace
                            a great, full-featured microblogging client like Spaz.
